# Deep-Hedging-and-Valuation
•	Developed deep learning approaches (feed-forward and recurrent artificial neural network) with Python (PyTorch) to determine the optimal hedging strategy for a short position on a bull call spread; set past/current stock prices and current time as input parameters and CVaR0.1 as the objective loss function

•	Compared the deep learning hedging strategies with the traditional move-based and time-based delta/delta-gamma hedging strategies within the Black-Scholes framework

•	Investigated how neural network hyperparameters, rebalancing bandwidth, and realized volatility impacted hedging portfolio PnL distributions
